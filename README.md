# Hotel Booking Analysis Dashboard | Power BI

This repository contains an interactive Power BI dashboard project that analyzes hotel booking data from a city hotel and resort hotel. The dashboard provides valuable insights into customer behavior, booking trends, cancellations, market segments, and revenue performance.

## Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard helps answer key business questions for hotel managers and analysts, such as:

- When are bookings most frequent throughout the year?
- What is the cancellation rate by customer type or deposit policy?
- Which market segments and distribution channels are most effective?
- How does guest demographic vary across hotels?
- What is the average daily revenue (ADR) per booking?

## Key Insights

- Cancellation Patterns: High cancellation rates are linked with longer lead times and non-refundable bookings.
- Market Segmentation: Online travel agents are the most common source of bookings.
- Guest Behavior: Most guests travel in pairs (2 adults), and repeated guests are more loyal to city hotels.
- Revenue Trends: Resort hotels tend to have higher ADR during peak months.
